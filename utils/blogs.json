                "description": "With Denis Villeneuve at the helm, Dune is a sci-fi epic that adapts into a stunning cinematic piece the legendary 1965 novel by Frank Herbert.

Starting from the sweeping sandworm shots to the haunting soundscapes, every frame has been carefully curated like a fine art piece. Theologically, Dune offers readers a profound oscillation over the story with deep-seated themes of ecology, colonialism, and an ever looming presence of fate. Characters like Lady Jessica and Duke Leto offer further depth to the previously unexplored dimensions of people’s relationships.",
